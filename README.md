# Simplest example for TypeScript Property Decorators

## To run:
```
git clone https://github.com/PaulLockwood/TypeScript-Property-Decorator-Example.git
yarn install
yarn run build
yarn run start
```

## Summary
Getting the demo code to run proved trickier than expected.

This is the is simplest example I could create. It uses code from this page: <https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html>

## Dependcies
Before running you should have these installed:

node.js v6.x
yarn

It should be possible to use npm, just replace yarn with npm
